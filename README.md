# Overview

In math, order of operations are the rules that state the sequence in which the multiple operations in an expression should be solved. Also known as PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Addition, Subtractions) which is the order in which we solve the operations.

Rules: 
*User input must have spaces between each integer. 
*Next click the solve equation button
*The following steps will be shown.
*Click the reset button to clear out  the current operation.

# Development Environment

The tools we used to developed this apps were: 
* Android Studio
* Kotlin plugin 
* IntelliJ 
* Python 

Kotlin is an open-source statically typed programming language that targets the JVM, Android, JavaScript and Native. It’s developed by JetBrains. 
Kotlin has both object-oriented and functional constructs. You can use it in both OO and FP styles, or mix elements of the two. With first-class support for features such as higher-order functions, function types and lambdas, Kotlin is a great choice if you’re doing or exploring functional programming.
Kotlin is supported by all major Java IDEs including IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio, and Eclipse. In addition, a command line compiler is available and provides straightforward support for compiling and running applications.
